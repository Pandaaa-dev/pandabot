  "description": "Hey @everyone! Sorry for the ping but this is a very important update. This new update has an addition of many new features! I hope you guys like it and use it too 😅 The features are as follows: \n\n>>> Food Hunt\nThis is a whole new module in the bot! You can get to know about it by typing `!help foodhunt`. This module is basically a hunting game. Hunt for food in the monsters with your trusty sword you can get from the hunting shop! If you wanna be extra safe, you can use a few *potions* too! Last but not least, sell all the food you get from hunting and rise up the ladder of the riches! Good Luck Warrior!\n\n>>> Gifting\nGifting has finally been added to the bot! You can see the giftshop by typing `!giftshop`. Presently, it doesnt change your *waifu* worth but in the future it will be integrated. Appreciate your friends by giving them the best gifts!\n\n>>> Other Updates\n\n> A **Sightseeing** mode has been added. If you don't want the bot to track xp, economy and other stuff(maybe your server is a bit more serious), then you can type `!sightseeing` and it will be turned on. This command is only accessible to server owners and me\n\n> Random currency pickup codes have been added!\n\n> The entertainment command `!lurk` was added",

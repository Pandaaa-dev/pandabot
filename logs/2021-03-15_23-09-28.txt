Blue Flash#1141 from Retired Gamers at 📙【holy-bible: 12 September, 2015
The Principal,
Dhaka Women College,
Dhaka.

Subject: Prayer for increasing/enhancing library facilities.

Sir,
We, the students of your college, humbly beg to draw your attention to the fact that we have a big library in our college but there is no enough facilities in it. The library is neither enriched with essential and modern books nor is it equipped with necessary things. There are no story books and novel by the modern writers. We also need Poetry books, translations, reference book like World Diary, dictionary and encyclopedia, religious books etc. Library card system has not yet been introduced.

Moreover, Sitting environment needs to be improved. Placing two more reading tables can solve our problem for the time being. At least four Bengali and English dailies are to be supplied regularly. Two more fans and a light are also needed.


We, therefore, pray and hope that your honor would be gracious enough to take urgent steps to solve our problems providing the facilities stated above and oblige thereby.

Yours sincerely
Sadia Afrin
On behalf of the students of Dhaka Women College
